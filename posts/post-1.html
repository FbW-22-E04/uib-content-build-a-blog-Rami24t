          Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain[b] is a 2015 stealth game
          developed by Kojima Productions and published by Konami. It is the
          ninth installment in the Metal Gear series that was directed, written,
          and designed by Hideo Kojima following Metal Gear Solid V: Ground
          Zeroes, a stand-alone prologue released the previous year; it is his
          final work at Konami. Set in 1984, nine years after the events of
          Ground Zeroes, the story follows mercenary leader Punished "Venom"
          Snake as he ventures into Soviet-occupied Afghanistan and the
          Angola–Zaire border region to exact revenge on the people who
          destroyed his forces and came close to killing him during the climax
          of Ground Zeroes.

          Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain was released worldwide for
          Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox
          One on September 1, 2015. It received critical acclaim, with praise
          for its gameplay, player freedom, open world, graphics, themes, and
          performances; its narrative, ending twist, and certain changes to the
          series formula divided critics, while the portrayal of the character
          Quiet drew criticism. The game's repeated missions and ending that
          left plot points unresolved, attributed with conclusive evidence of
          removed content, led some to label the game unfinished. The Phantom
          Pain received perfect review scores from several publications and was
          described as one of the greatest stealth games of all time. A complete
          edition that bundles The Phantom Pain and Ground Zeroes together,
          titled Metal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience, was released in
          October 2016.
