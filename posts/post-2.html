          Horizon Zero Dawn is a 2017 action role-playing game developed by
          Guerrilla Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The
          plot follows Aloy, a young huntress in a world overrun by machines,
          who sets out to uncover her past. The player uses ranged weapons, a
          spear, and stealth to combat mechanical creatures and other enemy
          forces. A skill tree provides the player with new abilities and
          bonuses. The player can explore the open world to discover locations
          and take on side quests. It was released for the PlayStation 4 in 2017
          and Microsoft Windows in 2020. Horizon Zero Dawn is Guerrilla Games'
          first intellectual property since Killzone in 2004 and its first
          role-playing game. Development began in 2011 after the completion of
          Killzone 3, with director Mathijs de Jonge considering it the riskiest
          idea pitched at the time. The game engine, Decima, was developed for
          Killzone: Shadow Fall and altered for Horizon Zero Dawn. Being set in
          a post-apocalyptic setting, anthropologists were consulted to
          authenticate the world's decay over a millennium. The soundtrack was
          led by composer Joris de Man, featuring contributions from The Flight.

          Horizon Zero Dawn was praised by critics for its open world, story,
          visuals, combat, characterization, and the performance of voice
          actress Ashly Burch; however, the dialogue, melee combat, and
          character models received some criticism. The game won numerous awards
          and sold over 20 million copies by February 2022, making it one of the
          best-selling PlayStation 4 games. An expansion, The Frozen Wilds, was
          released in November 2017. A sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, was
          released for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on 18 February 2022.
