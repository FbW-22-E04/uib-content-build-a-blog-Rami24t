          The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[a] is an action role-playing game developed
          by Polish developer CD Projekt Red, and first published in 2015. It is
          the sequel to the 2011 game The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and the
          third game in The Witcher video game series, played in an open world
          with a third-person perspective. The games are based on The Witcher
          series of fantasy novels written by Andrzej Sapkowski. The game takes
          place in a fictional fantasy world based on Slavic mythology. Players
          control Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer for hire known as a Witcher,
          and search for his adopted daughter, who is on the run from the
          otherworldly Wild Hunt. Players battle the game's many dangers with
          weapons and magic, interact with non-player characters, and complete
          quests to acquire experience points and gold, which are used to
          increase Geralt's abilities and purchase equipment. The game's story
          has three possible endings, determined by the player's choices at key
          points in the narrative.

          Development began in 2011 and lasted for three and a half years.
          Central and Northern European cultures formed the basis of the game's
          world. REDengine 3 enabled the developer to create a complex story
          without compromising the game's open world. The music was primarily
          composed by Marcin Przybyłowicz and performed by the Brandenburg State
          Orchestra. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was released for Microsoft
          Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in May 2015, with a Nintendo
          Switch version released in October 2019, and PlayStation 5 and Xbox
          Series X/S versions planned for release in 2022. The game received
          critical acclaim, with praise for its gameplay, narrative, world
          design, combat, and visuals, although it received minor criticism due
          to technical issues. It received numerous game of the year awards and
          has been cited as one of the best video games ever made. Two
          expansions were also released to critical acclaim: Hearts of Stone and
          Blood and Wine. A Game of the Year edition was released in August
          2016, with the base game, expansions and all downloadable content. The
          game shipped over 40 million copies, making it one of the best selling
          video games of all time.
